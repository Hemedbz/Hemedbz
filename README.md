- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hemed Tov. @Hemedbz
- Iâ€™m an operational excellence manager, so I take low-tech slow manual proccesses and improve them.
- I create automations, and implement new apps and software where needed (in adition to non-techy improvements such as the warehouse floor plan or changing the workload in a team).
- ðŸŒ± While doing that, I realized I actually kinda like coding. So I took a Fullstach development class.
- And here I am!
